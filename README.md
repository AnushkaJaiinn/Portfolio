# Rebirth by Anushka Jain (Version 2.0)

A premium, single-offer authority website designed to position Anushka Jain as a thought leader in personal branding. This project represents the evolution from a standard portfolio (Version 1.0) to a high-converting, narrative-driven experience (Version 2.0).

## 🌟 Version 2.0: The Rebirth Transformation

This version shifts focus from "freelance services" to a comprehensive transformation program called **Rebirth**.

### Key Features

- **Single-Offer Positioning**: All content is streamlined to promote one core offer: *Rebirth*.

- **Strategic Cleanup**: Removed multi-service clutter, social media aggregators, and resume-style lists.
